Nerditest is a simple project used in GTUG and other events as a way to introduce Google technologies, engage audience, and encore socialization and collaboration among them.

Nerditest stands for Nerdity Test, which is a test that evaluate user for nerdity. [http://www.armory.com/tests/nerd500.html here] is a sample of such test. The system will use a sub group of these questions in building an Android application, and then we will ask the audience to submit their answers.

The server will receive a code representing each user, user name and the answer for the question. For each

 * User will first send his/her name and the team name. 
 * Server will add the user to the list of teams after verifications
 * User will answer the questions, once a time, sending the result each time.
 * Server will add the result to the team result and will send it to the GWT client, which will show the results for each team on a big screen.
 * Upon sending the final result, the server will send back to the user his mark
 * Final result will show which team are considered the nerds

=Grading=
 * Submitting the name and the team name indicate that the user wrote and built the application (5 marks)
 * For each correct answer, user will be given 1.5, total (15 marks)
